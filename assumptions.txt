Here will be added all the assumptions that's simplify or are interesting for the project.
1)There is a master node, main, that launch on worker the mapper and reducer tasks.
1.1)Is master responsibility to merge data obtained from reducer.
2)The algorithm converge when all the nodes have the same value for 2 iterations or the difference is less than epsilon
2.1)If doesn't converge the execution stops after 100 iteration
